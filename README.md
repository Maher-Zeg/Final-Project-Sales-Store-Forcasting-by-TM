## Project Description

This project is about time series forcasting for store sales. The data comes from an Ecuador company as known as Corporaci√≥n Favorita and it is a large grocery retailer. Also, the company operates in other countries in South America.

There are 54 stores and 33 prodcut families in the data. The time serie starts from 2013-01-01 and finishes in 2017-08-15.




## Work Process

There are 6 data that we will study on them step by step.

Train
Test
Store
Transactions
Holidays and Events
Daily Oil Price

The train data contains time series of the stores and the product families combination. The sales column gives the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).The onpromotion column gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store at a given date.

Stores data gives some information about stores such as city, state, type, cluster.

Transaction data is highly correlated with train's sales column. You can understand the sales patterns of the stores.

Holidays and events data is a meta data. This data is quite valuable to understand past sales, trend and seasonality components. However, it needs to be arranged. You are going to find a comprehensive data manipulation for this data. That part will be one of the most important chapter in this notebook.

Daily Oil Price data is another data which will help us. Ecuador is an oil-dependent country and it's economical health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices. That's why, it will help us to understand which product families affected in positive or negative way by oil price.

"Additional Notes" : 
Wages in the public sector are paid every two weeks on the 15 th and on the last day of the month. Supermarket sales could be affected by this.
A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Ecuador on April 16, 2016. People rallied in relief efforts donating water and other first need products which greatly affected supermarket sales for several weeks after the earthquake.
